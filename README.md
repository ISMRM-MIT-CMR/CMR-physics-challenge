# ISMRM Member Initiated Tutorial — Cardiac MR Physics Coding Challenge
# 
# This notebook contains a simple MRI simulator which can be used to define a custom pulse sequence and simulate an image acquisition on a phantom.
# During this tutorial we will simulate a spoiled GRE sequence on a cardiac phantom and we will observe the effects of blood flow.

# SUBMISSION: Please use the code provided in the submission form to solve the actual challenge. To submit, please upload to the submission form:
# 1) Your modified code as Jupyter notebook (*.ipynb)
# 2) The slide template containing:
# 	- A short abstract on your solution
# 	- A plot of your sequence diagram
# 	- A figure containing: the original image, the reconstructed image with flow "scanned“ with the unmodified spGRE sequence, and the reconstructed image with flow „scanned“ with your modified sequence
