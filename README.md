# ISMRM Member Initiated Tutorial — Cardiac MR Physics Coding Challenge

The repository is part of the [ISMRM member-initiated tutorial Cardiovascular MR: From Theory to Practice](https://ismrm-mit-cmr.github.io/). 

## Tutorial

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ISMRM-MIT-CMR/CMR-physics-challenge/blob/master/ISMRM_final_live.ipynb)

This notebook contains a simple MRI simulator which can be used to define a custom pulse sequence and simulate an image acquisition on a phantom.
During this tutorial we will simulate a spoiled GRE sequence on a cardiac phantom and we will observe the effects of blood flow.

**Submission:**
Once you open the submission link, you have **90 minutes** to submit your solution. <br/>
Please fill out the submission form and upload in this form:
- Template: Containing your abstract and overview figure
	- A short abstract on your solution
	- A plot of your sequence diagram
	- A figure containing: the original image, the reconstructed image with flow "scanned“ with the unmodified spGRE sequence, and the reconstructed image with flow 
- Results: Your Jupyter notebook as `*.ipynb` containing the modified pulse sequence code
